CAN2matrix - AVR based project to get infromation from one CAN bus to another.
==============================================================================

Since new cars come with CAN bus to control anything, the need to use these
signals arose when trying to build in my old CAN controlled radio.

Single CAN solutions exist, but often they lack in something or other. So I
used the tips and tricks to combine such solutions.

Both CAN buses (could) use a different bitrate. Only a small number of
signals are needed to communicate between buses. Sleep and/or power down
functionality is a must, if you don't want to help your car waking up after
a weekend ;-). Of course, if you have acces sto information, make use of it.

Current Stage:
==============

Only a small testprogram is now available with a single MCP2515 attached to
an ATmega8. It simply gets messages and sends them back with the message id
increased by 10. Simple, but it works.

Next Steps/Ideas:
=================
(M) mandatory
(O) optional

- (M) Power Down (all chips including AVR) by CAN bus sleep
- (M) Wake Up by CAN activity on the (master) bus
- (M) Implement "The CAN Matrix" in code
- (O) Additional functionality, like PDC distance showed by LEDs
- (O) EEPROM use for message matrix
- (O) make use of other AVRs to include CAN2analog or Analog2CAN possibility
- (O) turn lights using fog lights with fade out

Have fun!
